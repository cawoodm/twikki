      "text": "The [[$CorePackages]] tiddler contains a [[DataList]] of packages to import when TWikki first loads.\n\nCore Packages are a select few packages which form the base of twikki i.e. necessary functionality.\nThese should be distinguished from [[$ExtensionPackages]] which provided additional functionality.\n\n## What is a Package?\n\nA package, at it's most basic is just a URL which returns a list of tiddlers. Technically a package is an object with at least one property `tiddlers` of type Array.\n\nThese tiddlers:\n* may contain functionality or data\n* once loaded, all code tiddlers are executed\n* can encapsulate things like themes or plugins\n* may or may not be stored depending on flags applied when importing them\n\n## Import Flags\nIn addition to URLs you can specify options as to how tiddlers are auto-imported:\n\n* `save`: Set the `save` flag to ensure imported tiddlers are stored locally when you save. The default is off so imported tiddlers are nor persisted. By default the `core` and `icons` packages are set to `save` so that you have basic functionality offline\n* `force`: Set the `overwrite` flag to ensure the entire package is always imported even if this means overwriting tiddlers you may have changed. The default is off which means the auto-importer will prompt you about overwriting tiddlers you may have changed.\n* `nooverwrite`: Set the `nooverwrite` flag if you plan to change imported tiddlers and don't want them overwritten. The auto-importer will just skip importing them if the tiddler exists\n\n## Road Map\nCurrently Packages are just URLs, later we will introduce the concept of Repos which store a list of uniquely named packages and their URLs.\nAt that time we can simply refer to packages by their unique name (e.g. `core` or `backup-plugin`).\n\n- In future a package will contain more metadata e.g. name, version, author etc.\n- You will also be able to define update policies for packages e.g. if you want automatic updating of core patches or minor updates to extensions\n\n\n",

By using the core function `getKeyValuesArray` we can parse such `key:value` lists into an array of objects with `{key, value}` pairs which is useful for storing simple configurations.\n\nA more functional example would be [[$CorePackages]] which stores a list of URLs of packages to import. $CorePackages is interesting because it's just a bunch of strings `<url> flag,option` but the application parses each line to determine what flags and options apply to each url.\n\nIn future we will offer a new type `table` which clearly separates the fields and displays them as a table.\n\nNote: For `list` tiddlers only those lines marked as list items (beginning with `* `) are considered for the list.

Strictly speaking we don't need this to be a single tiddler since we can include separate tiddlers into one and just add all separate tiddlers to a single package.

      "text": "Parameters are used to pass messages to objects or widgets.\n\nFor example `<<example.greet Mr. Smith>>` passes 2 string parameters to the `greet` [[Widget]] in [[ExamplePlugin]].  Technically it's one parameter `\"red,green,blue\"` (because there are no spaces) and thus the widget must `split()` the string into an array.\n\nSince TWikki is text based the string `\"red green blue\"` must be parsed to produce parameters. We support 2 basic strategies for function parameters (named and unnamed).\n\n## Unnamed Parameters\nTradional JavaScript functions accept the passing of multiple unnamed (or positional) parameters as in `function macro(p1, p2, p3)` which accepts 3 arguments. We can invoke it as such:\n* `<<macro foo bar>>` becomes `macro(\"foo\", \"bar\")` (unquoted space-separated strings)\n* `<<macro 1 true car>>` becomes `macro(1, true, \"car\")` (literal numbers and booleans)\n* `<<macro 1 \"true car\">>` becomes `macro(1, \"true car\")` (quoted strings with spaces)\n* `<<macro 1 true \"{foo()}\">>` becomes `macro(1, true, foo())` (eval expression)\n\nNote: Technically the parameters are parsed into an array which is then spread as it is passed to the function.\n\n## Named Parameters\nModern JavaScript functions expect a single object as a parameter or what may be called named parameters:\nConsider the `function greet({title, lastName})` which accepts 2 named parameters. It can be invoked as such:\n* `<<greet title:Mr. lastName:Smith>>` yielding `greet(\"Mr.\", \"Smith\")` (unquoted space-separated strings)\n* `<<greet title:\"Prof. Dr.\" lastName:\"Bryson\">>` yielding `greet(\"Prof. Dr.\", \"Bryson\")` (quoted strings with spaces)\nThe same rules for booleans `true/false` or numbers and eval expressions apply as above.\n\nNotes:\n* There may be no space before or after the `:` and properties may contain only characters `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` or the `_` .\n* Objects do not (yet) support dynamic/eval expressions like `foo:{fcn()}`\n\n## Arrays\nIt is not yet possible to pass an array to a function. We get around this by passing a csv string which the function can then manually `split(',')`.\nIn future arrays will be possible via comma-separated tokens:\n* `<<add 1,2,3>>` yielding `add([1, 2, 3])`\n\nFor example `<<selector red,green,blue>>` passes three colors to the [[SelectorWidget]].  Technically it's one parameter `\"red,green,blue\"` (because there are no spaces) and thus the widget must `split()` the string into an array.\n\n## Dynamic Parameters\nTWikki supports [[Commands]] which allow 3 types of serialized parameters:\n* ",
